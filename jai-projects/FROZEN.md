# JAI NEXUS - Frozen Infrastructure (Feb 1 - May 1, 2026)

The following domains/repos are **intentionally frozen** during the 90-day focus period.

They represent future vision, not current necessity.

## Frozen Domains
- community.nexus
- framework.nexus
- infra.nexus
- ingest.nexus
- integrations.nexus
- intelligence.nexus
- keytrust.nexus
- modelops.nexus
- privacy.nexus
- secureboot.nexus
- workflow.nexus

## Why Frozen
These will be activated **after**:
1. Chat memory system ships and is used daily for 30+ days
2. First external user (not Jerry) uses JAI NEXUS and finds value
3. Revenue > $0 OR grant funding secured

## When to Revisit
May 1, 2026 - Review whether to activate, archive, or sell these domains.

*Note to future Jerry: You were right to freeze these. It saved the project.*
